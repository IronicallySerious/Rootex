## <a name=what>What is Rootex?

Rootex is an advanced C++ multithreaded 3D game engine powering an in-production game yet to be announced. Rootex is planned to support a free 2.5D local multiplayer physics based sidescroller game to be shipped on Windows and using the DirectX 11 Graphics API.

This game will be a product of a join effort of SDSLabs and [Design Studio](https://designstudio.cc/).

## <a name=why>Why is Rootex?

Rootex is the direct successor of [Rubeus, our 2D Game Engine](https://github.com/sdslabs/Rubeus). Rubeus Engine is now being preserved and any newer features will be planned for Rootex and be implemented in Rootex instead of Rubeus. The game being developed will be announced soon. 

## <a name=setup>How do I use Rootex?

Rootex runs only on Windows and there are no plans to port it to other platforms.

1. Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/) and [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/).
2. Install Visual Studio Desktop C++ development pack (or anything similar, since C++ is no longer a default language since at least Visual Studio 19)
3. Run `generate_cache.bat`.
4. Use `build.bat` to build Rootex.
