Getting Started
===============

Rootex is a pure Entity-Component-System architectured game engine. We use terms like entities, components and systems analogous to the domain of ECS architecture. Find more information about these `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system>`_

.. note::
	This also means that the Rootex Editor is made with the Rootex Engine itself.

Rootex Editor is structured to work like popular game engines with its simplistic user interface.

Any user coming from ECS based game engines like Unreal Engine should be able to pick up the interface quickly.
