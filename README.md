# Rootex

An advanced C++ multithreaded 3D game engine powering an in-production game yet to be announced.

# Setup

## Windows:

1. Install Visual Studio 2019, CMake build system and Ninja build generator.
2. Install Desktop C++ development pack (or anything similar, since C++ is no longer a default language in Visual Studio)
3. Run `GenerateCache.bat` to create the `.sln` file.
4. Use `Build.bat` to build Rootex.
